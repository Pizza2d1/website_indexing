with Mr. Morgan.

Yes, ma'am, that's me.
I want to know

661
00:33:07,499 --> 00:33:09,500
everything there is to know
about being a pilot.

662

What airports
does Pan Am fly to?

make in a year?

they're gonna fly to?

667
00:33:17,709 --> 00:33:18,876
All right.
What does it mean

668
00:33:18,877 --> 00:33:20,478
when one pilot says
to another pilot,

669
00:33:20,479 --> 00:33:22,045
"What kind of equipment
are you on?"

670
00:33:22,046 --> 00:33:24,582
They just want to know what
kind of aircraft you're flying,

671
00:33:24,583 --> 00:33:26,016
Is it a DC-8, 707,
Constellation?

672
00:33:26,017 --> 00:33:28,686
And what about those I.D. badges
that I've seen pilots wear?

673
00:33:28,687 --> 00:33:31,489
Well, every pilot has to have two
things with him at all times,

674
00:33:31,490 --> 00:33:33,123
One is his airline
personnel badge...

675
00:33:33,124 --> 00:33:35,125
looks just like this
one here, from Pan Am...

676

the other one is
their FAA license...

think I can

679
00:33:42,266 --> 00:33:45,736

to put into my article?

Aw, thanks!
And what about your I.D. badge?

683
00:33:50,542 --> 00:33:52,075
You have an extra
one I could borrow?

which was cashed in New York

does not go to the New York

Federal Branch.

The bank doesn't even know the
check has bounced for two weeks

927
00:44:14,281 --> 00:44:16,282
which means our unsub

You think you're going
to get me again?

You're not going to Vegas.

You're not

I'm really sorry

Yeah. I'm saving

Well, you want

No.
